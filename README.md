Deep Neural Network for Brain Pathology Detection:
• Developing a deep learning-based solution for automated detection of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) scans.
• To improve the model’s performance, I implemented various image preprocessing techniques, such as normalization, resizing,
and augmentation.
• Engineered a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract hierarchical
features from the MRI images.
• After training and validating the CNN model on a large dataset of labeled MRI scans, I achieved a highly accurate system
for identifying the presence of brain tumors.
• Finally, I integrated the trained CNN model into a practical solution that can provide real-time predictions on new MRI
scans, enabling early detection and timely treatment of brain tumors.
• Technologies Used: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Tkinter
